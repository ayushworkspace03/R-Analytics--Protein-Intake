This project explores the relationship between protein intake, resistance exercise, and changes in lean body mass (LBM). 
The dataset comprises experimental studies, capturing key variables like demographics, exercise type, energy balance, and protein intake levels, providing valuable insights into how these factors influence muscle mass changes.
